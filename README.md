## Files
  * `dircolors.256dark` - dark solarized theme for 256 color terminals (by [seebi](https://github.com/seebi))

## Usage
These dircolors database files uses solarized colors instead of the given

### 256 color schemes
To be able to use it, you need a 256 color terminal (e.g. gnome-terminal or
urxvt) and a correct `TERM` variable, e.g.:

    export TERM=xterm-256color        # for common 256 color terminals (e.g. gnome-terminal)
    export TERM=screen-256color       # for a tmux -2 session (also for screen)
    export TERM=rxvt-unicode-256color # for a colorful rxvt unicode session
